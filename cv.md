## Summary:

I have great passion for codding and building logical chains. Perfectionist, always trying to find the best way to optimize and perfect my work. I am in constant search to improve and develop my skills. I never give up on any opportunity to build my knowledge.

Citing my ancestor Alisher Navoi:
>Learning bit-by-bit one turns into wise,

>Gethering drop-by-drop one turns into river.

>(in original:

>Oz-oz o'rganib dono bo'lur, 

>qatra-qatra yig'ilib daryo bo'lur.)
